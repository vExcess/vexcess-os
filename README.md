# Vexcess OS
A Windows inspired operating system written in JS/HTML/CSS

Because it's written in JS/HTML/CSS you are able to run the OS using a web browser as the VM it's running in.
It can be demoed here: https://vexcess-os.vexcess.repl.co/

But not only can you simulate an OS in a browser, it is possible to compile it to a binary using Electron, stack it onto Linux, and then use it as a real operating system. But why you would actually ever want to do that is beyond me.

Limitations:
- There are so many limitations that I could not possibly list them all!
- Probably the most significant one is that at the moment the OS can only run software written in JavaScript. Theoretically I can utilize Web Assembly to get the ability to run some native programs.
- Also I've only actually written like 1% of the OS, so it's like 99% incomplete
